# Comparison of Machine Learning Models with Iris Dataset

This project utilizes the Iris dataset to evaluate the performance of different machine learning models. 
The Iris dataset is a dataset that classifies three different types of iris flowers based on various features such as sepal and petal lengths and widths.

This code utilizes the following machine learning algorithms:

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
